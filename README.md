# Micro_services_Mini_App
This is an App that I created while learning Micro services. A basic CRUD app which a Blog with comments.
These are the five parts of the Microservices
1. Client
2. Posts
3. Comments
4. Query
5. Events (Event Bus)
6. Comment Moderation

To run this Microservice. Go to each folder and run `npm i` to install all the dependencies and then run each app using  `npm start`. Bug is figured out. Moderation is now complete.It will moderate every comment that contains the keyword "Orange".App is right now complete.
